The bot  is currently operating at the MVP stage. The bot provides programmed responses, and it is also possible to ask it questions, to which it generates answers within the framework of the Qubic project. 

Aigarth (aNNa) is an advanced AI assistant in Telegram designed to provide users with instant and convenient interaction with the Qubic blockchain. The bot combines trained neural networks, a knowledge base, analytics tools, and services for mining, trading, and learning and other features. 

## Project Mission
To make the Qubic ecosystem accessible to everyone: from beginners to professional miners and traders. aNNa becomes a primary knowledge hub, analytical tool, and personal assistant for working with Qubic.

## aNNa Development Strategy:
Stage 1 - fully functional bot in Telegram
Stage 2 - integration of the bot into Discord
Stage 3 - integration of the bot into X
Integrate it into a mobile app or website
Stage 4 - If the project is in demand, we will be able to create an AI assistant in the form of a stand for conferences and AI events, where aNNa will be able to communicate with people and answer their questions, replacing or supplementing real people. We have already successfully implemented the MVP of this project in 2024.
